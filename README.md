- **Rating: 9.8/10**

---

## Standards Covered

### Fully Covered (100%)
- ✓ MA.7.AR.1.1 - Properties of Operations
- ✓ MA.7.AR.2.2 - Two-Step Equations
- ✓ MA.8.AR.2.1 - Multi-Step Equations (exceeds Grade 7!)

### Missing (0%)
- ✗ MA.7.AR.1.2 - Expression Equivalence (1 week to add)
- ✗ MA.7.AR.2.1 - One-Step Inequalities (8 weeks to add)

### Implicit (Not Labeled)
- ◐ MTR.1.1-7.1 - Mathematical Thinking (needs visibility)
- ◐ ELA.K12.EE.1.1 - Evidence-Based Reasoning (needs expansion)

---

## Curriculum Highlights

### Excellent Features
1. **21 well-designed levels** organized in 6 learning phases
2. **Mastery-based** - students don't advance until ready (80% required)
3. **Clear progression** - one concept added per phase
4. **Rigorous assessment** - checkpoints increase in difficulty
5. **Boss levels** - excellent culminating challenges
6. **Beyond scope** - includes Grade 8 concepts for strong preparation

### Equation Forms Covered
- Two-step: ax + b = c
- Two-step variations: ax - b = c, x/a + b = c
- Combining: ax + bx + c = d
- Distribution: a(x + b) = c, a(x + b) + c = d
- Variables both sides: ax + b = cx + d
- Combined: a(x + b) = cx + d
- Special solutions: infinite, no solution

## Recommendations Priority

### PRIORITY 1 - Do Now (1 week)
1. Add Expression Equivalence level (MA.7.AR.1.2)
   - This fills a conceptual gap
   - Takes only 1 week to develop
   - Increases understanding of Levels 4-5

### PRIORITY 2 - Do Next (8 weeks)
2. Add Inequalities Module (MA.7.AR.2.1)
   - This completes Grade 7 standards (100% coverage)
   - 6 new levels following same structure
   - Achieves full alignment with state standards

### PRIORITY 3 - Later (ongoing)
3. Make MTR explicit (2 weeks)
   - Add callouts to show which practices are addressed
   - Helps teachers see standards connections

4. Expand ELA integration (2 weeks)
   - Add written explanations throughout
   - Build communication skills alongside math

5. Add real-world context (4 weeks)
   - Word problems, applications
   - Increase student engagement and relevance
