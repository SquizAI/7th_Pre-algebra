---

## PART 3: DETAILED GAP ANALYSIS

### Critical Standards NOT Covered

#### 1. MA.7.AR.1.2 - Expression Equivalence
**Why It's Missing:** The curriculum jumps from teaching properties (MA.7.AR.1.1) directly to solving equations, without explicitly teaching expression comparison.

**What's Needed:**
- A level comparing equivalent expressions without equations
- Example: "Is 3x + 2x equivalent to 5x?" OR "Is 2(x + 3) equivalent to 2x + 6?"
- Pre-Level 4 insertion

**Severity:** MODERATE
- Foundation for understanding properties
- Not critical for equation solving, but pedagogically important
- Students may not understand *why* combining like terms works

**Recommendation:** Add Level 3.5: "Expression Equivalence Quiz"

---

#### 2. MA.7.AR.2.1 - One-Step Inequalities
**Why It's Missing:** Curriculum has explicit scope boundary: equations only, not inequalities.

**What's Missing:**
- Solving x + 3 > 7
- Solving 2x < 10
- Understanding inequality vs. equality
- Graphing solutions on number lines

**Severity:** HIGH
- Complete standard not covered
- Important skill for Grade 7
- Prerequisite for more complex inequalities

**Recommendation:** Add separate Inequality Module (would be 5-7 new levels)
- Level 22-24: One-step inequalities
- Level 25-26: Two-step inequalities
- Would roughly follow equation progression

---

#### 3. MA.7.AR.4.2-4.5 - Proportional Relationships
**Why It's Missing:** Different mathematical focus area entirely.

**Scope:** Constant of proportionality, graphing, ratio problems

**Severity:** NOT APPLICABLE
- These are separate units in Grade 7 curriculum
- Not within scope of equation-solving module
- Would be in different unit: "Ratios & Proportions"

---

### Partially or Implicitly Covered Standards

#### MA.K12.MTR Standards (Mathematical Thinking and Reasoning)
**Current Status:** Embedded but not explicitly assessed

**How They're Addressed:**
- MTR.1.1: Levels 17-19 require persistence with complex problems
- MTR.2.1: Step-by-step solutions provide representations
- MTR.3.1: Multiple solution paths exist (e.g., solving 4(x+7)=12)
- MTR.4.1: Level 21 explicitly includes mathematical discussion
- MTR.5.1: All levels build both procedural skill AND conceptual understanding
- MTR.7.1: Levels 4-5 explicitly about recognizing structure (like terms)

**Recommendation:** More explicit MTR connection in level descriptions

---

### Out-of-Scope Standards
These are Grade 7 standards NOT addressed because outside curriculum scope:
- MA.7.NSO.1.1-1.3: Operations with rational numbers (prerequisite, not focus)
- MA.7.NSO.2.1-2.3: Number system concepts
- MA.7.RP.1.1-1.3: Ratios and proportional relationships
- MA.7.G.1.1-2.6: Geometry standards
- MA.7.SP.1.1-3.8: Statistics and probability

**These are appropriate to exclude** - they're different curricular units.

---

## PART 4: REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS

### Identified Redundancies

#### Redundancy 1: Levels 1 & 2 (Two-Step Basic)
- **Levels Affected:** 1 & 2
- **Content:** Both teach same equation form: ax + b = c
- **Mastery Requirements:** Same (4/5)
- **Hints:** Both offer hints
- **Assessment:** Level 3 is the actual assessment

**Analysis:**
- This appears intentional for fluency building
- May be excessive (2 levels of same content)
- Could reduce to 1 practice level

**Recommendation:** Consider combining into single level OR move Level 2 content into Level 3 mixed practice

---

#### Redundancy 2: Levels 4 & 5 (Combining Like Terms)
- **Levels Affected:** 4 & 5
- **Content:** Both teach same equation form: ax + bx + c = d
- **Mastery Requirements:** Same (4/5)
- **Hints:** Both offer hints
- **Assessment:** Level 6 is the actual assessment

**Analysis:**
- Similar to 1 & 2, provides practice repetition
- May be necessary for fluency with new concept
- Slightly better justified (new major concept vs. review)

**Recommendation:** Keep but monitor engagement - may have redundancy threshold

---

#### Redundancy 3: Levels 7 & 8 (Distributive Property)
- **Levels Affected:** 7 & 8
- **Similarity:** Both distributive property
- **Difference:** Level 8 adds extra constant, making it materially different
- **Mastery Requirements:** Same (4/5)

**Analysis:**
- NOT redundant - Level 8 is genuinely harder
- Forms are: a(x + b) = c vs. a(x + b) + c = result
- Appropriate scaffolding

**Recommendation:** Keep as-is

---

### Pattern Assessment
**Overall Redundancy Level:** LOW
- Repeated practice is intentional for mastery-based learning
- Each "practice" level comes before an assessment level
- Structure: Intro → Practice → Assessment → Next Concept

**Verdict:** Redundancy appears to be pedagogically intentional, not accidental

---

### Learning Progression Chain

```
PREREQUISITE (Grade 6): One-step equations
    ↓
PHASE 1: Two-step equations
    ├─ Level 1-2: Basic two-step (ax + b = c)
    └─ Level 3: Assessment + mixed forms
    ↓
PHASE 2: Combining like terms (adds left-side complexity)
    ├─ Level 4-5: Combine, then solve
    └─ Level 6: Assessment + integration with two-step
    ↓
PHASE 3: Distributive property (adds left-side complexity)
    ├─ Level 7-8: Distribution before solving
    └─ Level 9: Assessment + integration
    ↓
PHASE 4: Variables on both sides (adds right-side complexity)
    ├─ Level 10-11: Moving x terms
    ├─ Level 12: Both sides WITH distribution (combines phases)
    └─ Level 13: Assessment + integration
    ↓
PHASE 5: Special solutions (adds abstract reasoning)
    ├─ Level 14: Infinite solutions (one case)
    ├─ Level 15: No solution (contrasting case)
    └─ Level 16: Assessment + classification
    ↓
PHASE 6: Mastery & application
    ├─ Level 17: Mixed difficulty with support
    ├─ Level 18: Hard difficulty no support
    ├─ Level 19: Ultimate challenge
    ├─ Level 20: Celebration/review
    └─ Level 21: Bonus - special focus on solutions
    ↓
PROGRESSION TO (Grade 8): Multi-step equations + systems
```

**Strengths of Progression:**
- Each phase adds ONE major complexity at a time
- Checkpoints consolidate before moving forward
- Boss levels integrate everything
- Spiral nature (each level reviews prior skills)

**Weakness in Progression:**
- No explicit focus on "reading" or "classifying" equations before solving
- MA.7.AR.1.2 (expression equivalence) skipped entirely
- Could benefit from Level 0: "What's in an equation?"

## PART 8: WEAKNESS ANALYSIS - AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### Critical Gaps

#### 1. Missing MA.7.AR.1.2 (Expression Equivalence)
**Severity:** MODERATE
**Why It Matters:** Students may understand how to solve equations but not understand *why* combining like terms is valid

**Fix:**
- Add a pre-Level 4 activity: "Which expressions are equal?"
- 2x + 3x = ?
- 2(x + 3) = ?
- Not solving equations, just identifying equivalence

**Estimated Impact:** Would strengthen conceptual understanding by 15-20%

---

#### 2. Missing MA.7.AR.2.1 (Inequalities)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Why It Matters:** Important Grade 7 standard, completely absent from curriculum

**Fix:**
- Add Levels 22-26: Inequality module
- One-step: x + 3 > 5
- Two-step: 2x - 4 < 8
- Graphing solutions on number line
- Would roughly mirror equation progression (5 levels)

**Estimated Impact:** Would complete Grade 7 standard coverage

---

#### 3. Reading & Classification Phase
**Severity:** LOW-MODERATE
**Why It Matters:** Students solve equations but may not develop equation "literacy"

**Missing Ability:**
- Identify which form an equation is
- Predict how many steps will be needed
- Choose solving strategy before solving

**Fix:**
- Add "Diagnostic" level where students classify equations without solving
- Optional, for deeper understanding
- Could be integrated into checkpoints

---

#### 4. Real-World Context
**Severity:** LOW
**Current Status:** Equations are abstract (just numbers and variables)

**What's Missing:**
- Word problems converted to equations
- "If a notebook costs $2 and you have $10, how many notebooks can you buy?"
- Applications for special solutions (when would an equation have no solution?)

**Note:** This may be intentional (focus on procedural skill) and might belong in different lesson type

---

#### 5. Cross-Curricular Connections
**Severity:** LOW
**Current Status:** Only Level 21 includes ELA standards

**Enhancement Opportunity:**
- More levels could include communication standards
- Students writing explanations of solving process
- Vocabulary building (coefficient, like terms, distributive property, etc.)
