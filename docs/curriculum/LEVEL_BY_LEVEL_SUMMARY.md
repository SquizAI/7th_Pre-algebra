EQUATION FORM COMPLEXITY PROGRESSION:

Phase 1: ax + b = c
         2x + 3 = 7
         ↓
Phase 2: ax + bx + c = d
         2x + 3x + 5 = 20

         ↓
Phase 3: a(x + b) = c
         2(x + 3) = 14
         (left side: distribute first)
         ↓
         a(x + b) + c = d
         2(x + 3) + 5 = 17
         (left side: distribute, then combine constants)
         ↓
Phase 4: ax + b = cx + d
         2x + 3 = x + 10
         (both sides: collect variables, then constants)
         ↓
         a(x + b) = cx + d
         2(x + 3) = x + 14
         (both sides: distribute, then collect variables)
         ↓
Phase 5: ax + b = ax + b
         2x + 3 = 2x + 3
         (infinite solutions: true statement)
         ↓
         ax + b = ax + c
         2x + 3 = 2x + 5
