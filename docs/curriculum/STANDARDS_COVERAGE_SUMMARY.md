### Not Covered (1/6)

#### MA.7.AR.1.2 - Determine if Expressions are Equivalent ✗
**Gap:** No level comparing expressions without solving equations

What's Missing:
- Is 3x + 2x equivalent to 5x?

What's Missing:
- Solving x + 3 > 7
- Solving 2x < 10
- Graphing solutions on number lines
- Understanding inequality vs. equality

**Severity:** HIGH
**Recommendation:** Add Inequality Module (Levels 22-27)

## OUT OF SCOPE (Appropriate to Exclude)

These Grade 7 standards are in different curricular units:
- MA.7.AR.4.2-4.5: Proportional relationships
- MA.7.NSO.1.1-2.3: Number system, operations
- MA.7.RP.1.1-1.3: Ratios and proportional reasoning
- MA.7.G.1.1-2.6: Geometry
- MA.7.SP.1.1-3.8: Statistics and probability

These would be taught in separate modules/units.

## REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS

### Identified Redundancies

**Levels 1 & 2:** Both teach ax + b = c
- Intentional: Fluency building before assessment
- Verdict: Acceptable (mastery-based design)

**Levels 4 & 5:** Both teach ax + bx + c = d
- Intentional: New major concept needs practice
- Verdict: Acceptable

**Levels 7 & 8:** Distributive property
- Level 8 adds extra constant (materially different)
- Verdict: NOT redundant - appropriate scaffolding

**Overall Assessment:** Redundancy is pedagogically intentional, not problematic

## CONCEPT PROGRESSION

### Learning Chain (One Concept at a Time)

```
One-Step Equations (Prerequisite - Grade 6)
    ↓
Two-Step Equations [Levels 1-3]
    ↓
Combining Like Terms [Levels 4-6]
    ↓
Distributive Property [Levels 7-9]
    ↓
Variables on Both Sides [Levels 10-13]
    ↓
Special Solutions (Infinite/None) [Levels 14-16]
    ↓
Mastery & Integration [Levels 17-20]
    ↓

   - 80% mastery required before progression
   - Checkpoints require 83-100%
   - No student left behind

2. **Excellent Scaffolding** (★★★★★)
   - Hints → Practice → Assessment → Integration
   - Complexity increases gradually
   - Clear learning objectives

3. **Conceptual Depth** (★★★★☆)
   - Beyond procedural (includes why, not just how)
   - Special solutions included (abstract reasoning)
   - Properties named explicitly

4. **Assessment Quality** (★★★★☆)
   - Regular checkpoints (every 3 levels)
   - Increasing rigor (hints fade)

5. **Boss Levels** (★★★★★)
   - Excellent culminating experience
   - Progressive difficulty (17 → 18 → 19)
   - Celebration level (20) for motivation

## KEY WEAKNESSES

1. **Missing Expression Equivalence** (MA.7.AR.1.2)
   - Not critical for equation solving
   - Impacts conceptual understanding
   - **Fix:** Add 1 level (easy)

2. **No Inequalities** (MA.7.AR.2.1)
   - Completely missing standard
   - Important Grade 7 skill
   - **Fix:** Add 6-level module (medium effort)

3. **Limited Real-World Context**
   - Mostly abstract equations
   - No word problems converted to equations
   - Could enhance relevance

4. **ELA Integration Limited**
   - Only Level 21 explicitly connects
   - Could require mathematical explanations throughout
